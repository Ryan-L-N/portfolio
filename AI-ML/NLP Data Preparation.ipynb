    "With the growth of large-scale natural language processing systems like ChatGPT, more and more groups are trying to build their own natural language processing systems for personal use. As a machine learning engineer, it is critical to not only be able to perform advanced modelling tasks, but to also critically assess the datasets that you use, especially if they rely on using data from several different domains interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we shall extract our own COVID-19 dataset from three separate sources (Twitter/X Data, News Article Data, and Research Paper Data ), and attempt to use data engineering to reduce the [Proxy A-Distance](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2006/hash/b1b0432ceafb0ce714426e9114852ac7-Abstract.html) between them. Reducing this distance should allow most systems trained on this data to focus on the content of the data, which we care about, instead of caring about the source of the data, which we do not care about. In doing so, we will demonstrate the importance of feature extraction when it comes to natural language processing."

    "### Question 6: Text cleaning and tokenization\n",
    "Implement the three functions `clean_string`, `tokenize` and `lemmatize` that perform the following text preprocessing tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `clean_text` should:\n",
    "    * convert the string to lower case.\n",
    "    * remove any instance of `'s` that is either followed by any whitespace character, or at the end of the string: `teacher's help` becomes `teacher help`, and `children's` becomes `children`.\n",
    "    * remove apostrophe character `'`: `don't` becomes `dont`. For simplicity we will only consider the character `'` as apostrophe (so `’` is not).\n",
    "    * remove leading and trailing space.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `tokenize` should:\n",
    "    * use `nltk.word_tokenize` to tokenize the input text.\n",
    "    * further break tokens at characters which are not digits 0-9 and not present in `string.ascii_letters`. For example, `a_b_c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`.\n",
    "    * maintain the token order as it appears in the original string.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `lemmatize` should:\n",
    "    * lemmatize each token individually.\n",
    "    * remove tokens that are stopwords or contain fewer than two characters (these two cases should be checked after the lemmatization step).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "* When lemmatizing a word, you should also specify the part-of-speech `pos` parameter. This can be obtained by calling `nltk.pos_tag` and using the first returned tag (in case there are multiple possibilities). You can interpret the returned tag as follows:\n",
    "    * If it starts with \"J\", it is an adjective.\n",
    "    * If it starts with \"V\", it is a verb.\n",
    "    * If it starts with \"R\", it is an adverb.\n",
    "    * Otherwise, it is a noun.\n",
    "* `nltk.pos_tag` should be called on each individual token, instead of on the entire tokenized text. For example, if the input string is `\"learning is fun\"`, you should call `nltk.pos_tag([\"learning\"])` to get the part-of-speech of `'learning'`, and input that to the lemmatizer. You may notice that in this case `\"learning\"` is classified as a verb (while it is a noun in the original sentence). However, this is not a problem, since our end goal is to reduce each token to its base form, not to correctly classify its part-of-speech.\n",
    "* If you use the regex character set `\\w`, note that it matches alphanumeric characters **and** the underscore character `_`."
